You can take a look at the **elections.html** or run the **elections.ipynb** notebook yourself.

If you choose the latter and would like to reproduce the exact results, then I'd recommend using 
[Anaconda3-4.0.0](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/) environment.<br>
Alternatively, you can download any of Anaconda distributions and create a virtual env with *Python 3.5.4*. 
    
    $ conda create -n your_env python=3.5.4
    
    $ conda activate your_env

Then, you can install modules with versions listed in **requirements.txt**.<br>
To do that, the following pip command should be sufficient:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    
Now, you should be good to go with:

    $ jupyter notebook
